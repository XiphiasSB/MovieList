# MovieList

A website that displays movies I have seen and rated at imdb. Added sorting and searching functions. Just an example site for learning react. You need an .evn file with an API key to omdbapi in order to run this site properly.

Your .evn file should be in the root folder and only have this line of code:

REACT_APP_OMDB_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
